## Step 1: Introduction and Disclaimer

Welcome to Run A Relay! Our goal is to make it as fast and easy
 as possible to set up a new Tor ( https://www.torproject.org/ )
 relay, with special emphasis placed on helping you
 choose a host/server provider based on crowdsourced information
 from The Tor Project's wiki
 ( https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoodBadISPs ).

We've distilled it all down to actionable steps!


## Step 2: Run or Donate?

If you have less than $10/month that you can spend on a server
 to run your relay, consider donating to one of these fine
 projects instead! This will make the Tor network more
 efficient.

## Step 4: Install Tor Daemon & Configure Relay

Use the impressively
 awesome ansible-relayor ( https://github.com/nusenu/ansible-relayor )
 to set up your relay on Debian, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD!

(Non-Debian preferred! Because diversity.)

Or set up without Ansible:

## Step 5: Thank You!

You're all set! Thank you so much for taking action to
 make the Tor network faster and more scalable!

Each new relay can potentially help thousands of people protect
 their privacy every single day. The more the merrier!
